## Setup
### Distributing a setuptools based project
Before you begin, make sure you have the latest versions of setuptools and wheel:
```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
```
To build a setuptools project, run this command from the same directory where setup.py is located:
```
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
This will generate distribution archives in the dist directory.

Before you upload the generated archives make sure youâ€™re registered on https://test.pypi.org/account/register/. You will also need to verify your email to be able to upload any packages. You should install twine to be able to upload packages:
```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
```
Now, to upload these archives, run:
```
python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```
To install your newly uploaded package `nbackend-pluginfactory`, you can use pip:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://upload.pypi.org/simple/ nbackend-pluginfactory
```
